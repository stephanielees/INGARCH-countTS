INGARCH process for count time series

Discrete time series can be found in many applications, and the nature of such time series is different from the continuous time series. Therefore, we need a different way to find the best process that could generate count time series. Integer-valued GARCH (INGARCH) is one of various models for modelling (nonnegative) discrete time series.
